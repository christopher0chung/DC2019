--------
write fancy for loop for screenPrint function.

add "catching" structure that makes it so pot values don't SNAP from one point to another when turned. they will have to pass over the original value before changes can be made. this only applies to pots that are used to control multiple values like the comman pots located on the bottom right of the system.

variable note length function working pretty well except for when the potentiometer value goes from "active" to "inactive" length mode while a note is currently active. this creates a repeat note off message from the note.

breaking out of loops or long ifs is a good idea even if it means a one input of dual input reading might be read on the next loop


FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION WITH HIGHER LANGUAGE
------------------------------------------
retrigger keyboard notes when node has multiple module sources that overlap true


PATCH MODE OUTPUT SCREEN
------------------------

SCENARIO I
Press and Hold Input Button
- Screen O_IX
Press Output Button
- Screen DONE

SCENARIO II
Press and Hold Output Button
- Screen OXI_
Press Input Button
- Screen Done

*add underscore blinking line to indicate waiting for user input
*error for attempting to connect input to input or output to output
*error msg for nodes that can't be patched when link attempted
